#Regression Modelling

Create a new file called lab08_ca.

The first relationship we are going to investigate is between the explanatory variable urbanrate and the response variable internetuserate from the gapminder data set.

The null hypothesis is that urban rate has no relationship with the internet use rate.
The alternate hypothesis is that a relationship exists between urbane rate and internet use rate.

These are both quantitative variables. From our scatterplot in lab 5 you can see a relationship may exist between these variables.

To identify the strength of this relationship we use linear regression.

We now test the model by determining the equation of the best fit line.

~~~
commonly seen as:
y = mx + b

Linear regression equation:
Ŷ = ß0 + ß1 * x
~~~

Y is the response variable
X is the explanatory variable

b/ß0 is the intercept parameter
m/ß1 is the slope parameter


Simple regression is where there is only one explanatory variable

In python we use the ordinary less squares or OLS function from the stats model formula API library.

Prior to doing this we must first replace any " " empty strings with NaN as we did before for both the urbanrate and internetuserate variables.
Then we must convert both variables to_numberic so that python interprets them correctly in order to run the OLS function.

Next enter the following code to perform the linear regression.

~~~

#regression for association between urbandrate and internet use rate
print('OLS regression model for the association between urbanrate and internet use rate')
reg1 = smf.ols('internetuserate ~ urbanrate',data=gapminder_data).fit()
print(reg1.summary())

~~~

Look at the output now:

Dep variable shows us the name of the response variable.
We can see the number of observations that had valid data on both response and explanatory variables and we therefore included in analysis.

The top right section of the summary informs us of the significance of the overall regression model. The R-Squared value tells us the proportion of the change in the response variable that is attributed to the explanatory variable. In this case 38 of the change in internet use rate can be explained by urban rate.

The Prob (F-statistic) value is very small, considerably less than our alpha level of 0.5 (95% confidence). This tells us that we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that urban rate is significantly associated with internetuserate.

Now we look at the parameter estimates to calculate our best fit line.

![](./img/03.png)

~~~

y = mx + b

y = slope(x) + intercept

internetuserate = .72 (urbanrate) + (-4.90 )

~~~

The middle section of the summary explains the effect of the explanatory variable on the response variable. The size of the coefficient for the explanatory variable tell us the size of the effect. In this example when urbanrate goes up by 1 then internetuserate will increase by .7202

Looking at the output for the coefficients there is a column labeled P>|t| . This gives us the p value for our explanatory variable's association with the response variable. The p value is 0.000 which means that it is really small and less than .05 which is the generally accepted point at which you reject the null hypothesis. Here you would report the p value as p<.0001 and thus the likelihood of these results (i.e showing a relationship between the variables) coming up in a random distribution of data is less than 5%. Conversely you can say that with 95% probability that the variable urbanrate is having some affect on internetuserate.


We can now predict the value of Y when we know the value of X


- A country has 80% urbanisation, we can predict the value of y.


~~~

Ŷ = ß0 + ß1 * x

ß1=0.72
x=80
ß0=-4.90

ŷ= -4.90 + (0.72)(80)

= 52.7

~~~
We would expect 52.7 people out of every 100 to use the internet.

For every one unit increase in x we would expect y to increase by .72

Remember though this is the expected value that sits directly on the best fit line,  our data will differ to some extent. Expected data is not the same as observed data.

This model is limited by the fact that we impose a causal model rather than test for causation (experimental study).

For example, Canada has an urban rate of about 80%. However its Internet use rate is observed at 81.3 not 52.7, this is why we include an error term in our model. Statistics allows us to identify trends in the data, and use those trends to look at what we would expect our data to look like.


##Assessment
Conduct the same analysis on the explanatory variable lifeexpectancy and the response variable employrate.


- Write the null and alternate hypothesis in your code file (commented out)
- Present the mean and std dev for both variables.
- Conduct regression analysis to determine the relationship
- Report on the relationship in terms of p value.
- Apply your findings to discover what would the employrrate rate be for a life expectancy age of 80
