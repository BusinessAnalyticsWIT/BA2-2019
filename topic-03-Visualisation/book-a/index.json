Look back on previous labs to find the correct syntax for using the to_numeric() function in the Pandas library.\r\n\r\nIf the conversion is not working it may be because there are spaces or blanks in some observations for one or both of these variables.\r\n\r\nYou may have to use .replace() function to find any ' ' and replace with numpy.NaN again check back on previous lab files.\r\n\r\nOnce you have the conversions complete you can then describe each variable.\r\n\r\nWrite the statements to describe each variable and print the output so you can see the count, mean, standard deviation etc for each variable.\r\n"

For this example we ask python to suppress the line of best fit. Again we use the xlabel, ylabel and title functions.\r\n\r\n![](./img/05.png)\r\n\r\nHere we can see what looks like a positive relationship between urban rate and internet use rate. Change the code slightly so that the best fit line is displayed.\r\n\r\n![](./img/06.png)\r\n\r\n##Exercises\r\n\r\nTry plotting a scatter chart now for the explanatory variable incomeperperson with the response variable internetuserate.\r\nWhat relationship does this chart present? Is it stronger or weaker than the previous relationship?\r\n\r\nHow closely do the dots follow the linear pattern?\r\n\r\nThese examples show the different types of relationships presented by a scatter plot.\r\n\r\n![](./img/07.png)\r\n\r\nNot all relationships can be classified as positive or negative. Also if you can't plausibly put a line through the dots, if the dots are just a cloud of specks on a graph, then there may be no relationship.\r\n"

In this case it is hard to determine the relationship here.\r\n\r\nTo get a better sense of whether or not there is a relationship between these two variables, we could try and convert the incomeperperson explanatory variable into a categorical variable.\r\n\r\nTo do this we have to do some data management.\r\n\r\n- use the qcut function to split the incomeperperson variable into four equal parts, call the new variable incomegrp4.\r\n- display the frequency counts for the new variable and print them to the console.\r\n\r\n![](./img/09.png)\r\n\r\nNow you can see the distribution of the incomegrp4 variable. The four ordered groups we created, show that there are 48 in the lowest income group, 47 in the next 25%, 47 in the next 25% and 48 in the top 25%.\r\n\r\nWith this new categorical explanatory variable, you can now create the last type of bivariate graph, that is the categorical to quantitative bar chart.\r\n\r\nThe code to use is identical to that used for the categorical to categorical graph but what will be plotted on the y-axis is the mean HIV rate.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n#bivariate bar graph C->Q\r\nseaborn.factorplot(x='incomegrp4',y='hivrate',data=gapminder_data,kind='bar',ci=None)\r\nplt.xlabel('income group')\r\nplt.ylabel('mean HIV rate')\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n![](./img/10.png)\r\n\r\nIn this bar chart we can see the differences in HIV rate based on the counties income per person groups.\r\n"
