We think of it like a spreadsheet.\r\n\r\n##Managing Data: Creating Secondary Variables\r\n\r\nOne of the later steps in data management is evaluating whether you might want to create secondary variables. They are variables that include information from two or more primary variables.\r\n\r\nWe can create secondary variables by using a mathematical or logical operation on two or more variables.\r\n\r\nFor our set of data we want to know the number of cigarettes smoked per month. We created a new variable USFREQMO in the last lab which tells us an estimate of the number smoking days in a month for each respondent. If you look at the codebook the variable S3AQ3C1 holds values to answer the question of usual quantity per day.\r\n\r\nWe can simply multiple these two variables and the result represents the number of cigarettes per month smoked by respondents. We can call this new variable NUMCIGNO_EST\r\n\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nsubset2['NUMCIGMO_EST'] = subset2['USFREQMO'] * subset2['S3AQ3C1']\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nSometimes an error will occur to say you cannot do this operation due to datatypes being incompatible. You may need to make sure the variable S3AQ3C1 is in fact a number, you can add this piece of code to ensure this and then re-run the code above.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nsubset2['S3AQ3C1']=pandas.to_numeric(subset2['S3AQ3C1'])\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nHow can we check to make sure this new secondary variable was created as intended?\r\n\r\nWe will use a new statement that allows us to subset our data frame to only those variables we wish to see.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nsubset3=subset2[['IDNUM','S3AQ3C1',USFREQMO', 'NUMCIGMO_EST']]\r\nsubset3.head(25)\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n\r\n![](./img/00.png)\r\n\r\nYou can do a quick scan to ensure the operation was correct by multiplying the third column of data with the fourth to produce the last column of data.\r\n\r\nWhat you see in the above screenshot are the individual observations and the estimated number of cigarettes smoked in a month. This is a useful way to double check our work and make sure no errors have occurred.\r\n"

In this data set race or ethnicity are measured by a series of questions, coded 1 if yes and 0 if no.\r\n\r\nSome respondents could've indicated more than one race or ethnicity, we could decide to characterise those adolescents who indicate multiple racial or ethical groups separately from those who could be characterised with a single ethnicity.\r\n\r\nOpen the codebook that was part of the zip file you downloaded. Open the pdf name INH01PUB.pdf and scroll to question 4. The variables are named here and the values with frequencies are listed.\r\n\r\n- H1GI4\r\n- H1GI6A\r\n- H1GI6B\r\n- H1GI6C\r\n- H1GI6D\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new variable to create will be called NUMETHNIC, it will indicate the number of race or ethnicity variables that were endorsed. To do this we must sum the variables, so we must ensure they are of numerical data type.\r\n\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\ndata['H1GI4'] = pandas.to_numeric(data['H1GI4'])\r\ndata['H1GI6A'] = pandas.to_numeric(data['H1GI6A'])\r\ndata['H1GI6B'] = pandas.to_numeric(data['H1GI6B'])\r\ndata['H1GI6C'] = pandas.to_numeric(data['H1GI6C'])\r\ndata['H1GI6D'] = pandas.to_numeric(data['H1GI6D'])\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer back to the code book and you will see that each of these variables has a potential value of 6 which means refused to answer, and 8 which means don't know. We will need to deal with this missing data so it is no included in our sum operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n~~~\r\ndata['H1GI4'] = data['H1GI4'].replace([6,8], numpy.nan)\r\ndata['H1GI6A'] = data['H1GI6A'].replace([6,8], numpy.nan)\r\ndata['H1GI6B'] = data['H1GI6B'].replace([6,8], numpy.nan)\r\ndata['H1GI6C'] = data['H1GI6C'].replace([6,8], numpy.nan)\r\ndata['H1GI6D'] = data['H1GI6D'].replace([6,8], numpy.nan)\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following code with sum each of the variables and place the results into the new variable called NUMETHNIC\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\ndata['NUMETHNIC'] = data['H1GI4'] + data['H1GI6A'] + data['H1GI6B'] + data['H1GI6C'] + data['H1GI6D']\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n\r\nWrite the appropriate code to print out the following:\r\n\r\n![](./img/01.png)\r\n"

These are used to code the new variable ETHNICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\ndef ETHNICITY (row):\r\n    if row['NUMETHNIC']>1:\r\n        return 1\r\n    if row['H1GI4'] ==1:\r\n        return 2\r\n    if row['H1GI6A'] ==1:\r\n        return 3\r\n    if row['H1GI6B'] ==1:\r\n        return 4\r\n    if row['H1GI6C']==1:\r\n        return 5\r\n    if row['H1GI6D']==1:\r\n        return 6\r\n\r\ndata['ETHNICITY'] = data.apply(lambda row: ETHNICITY (row), axis=1)\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThe row code defines a temporary variable to be used in the function. Then we use the apply function to actually create the new variable in the dataset. Axis=1 tells Python to apply the function to each row.\r\n\r\nNote that the lambda operator/function is a way to create small anonymous functions (functions without a name). These functions are throwaways (like callback functions in JavaScript or PHP) That is, they are just needed where they are created. Lambda functions are commonly used in combination with the functions filter(), map(), and reduce().\r\n\r\nSo if NUMETHNIC the new variable ETHNICITY will return 1 indicating multiple racial or ethnic groups chosen.\r\n\r\nAll other codes then indicate a particular race for example:\r\n\r\n- H1GI4 equals 1 then the ETHNICITY variable will return a value of 2 which means only Hispanic or Latino ethnicity was chosen.\r\n- H1GI6A equals 1 then the ETHNICITY variable will return a value of 3 which means only Black or African-American ethnicity was chosen.\r\n- H1GI6B equals 1 then the ETHNICITY variable will return a value of 4 which means only American Indian ethnicity was chosen.\r\n- H1GI6C equals 1 then the ETHNICITY variable will return a value of 5 which means only Asian or Pacific Islander ethnicity was chosen.\r\n- H1GI6D equals 1 then the ETHNICITY variable will return a value of 6 which means only White  was chosen.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsider what you have learned and attempt to write the necessary code to print out the counts for each of these variables including the AID variable and NUMETHNIC and ETHNICITY so you can see the following first 25 rows. Use a subset of the data which just contains the variables you need.\r\n\r\n![](./img/02.png)\r\n\r\nIf you can not see all columns you can set the following option to expand the visible columns:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\npandas.set_option('display.max_columns',20);\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThis sets the maximum columns displayed to 20.\r\n"
